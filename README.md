# House-prices-advanced-regression

## Introduction
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
I have predicted the final price of the house with the help of 79 variables. This project is avaliable on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
